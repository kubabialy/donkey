## What is this
This repo is an attempt to create a programming language. 
Initally it will fairly strictly follow instructions in "Writing An Interpreter In Go", but the goal is 
to create a network oriented programming language that makes building HTTP API's fun... some day.

Also - great way to dive deeper into Golang.

## Shout out
This repository would not have come about at all if it were not for the work Thorsten Ball put into the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go". 
If you want to support someone, I don't know anyone better.
